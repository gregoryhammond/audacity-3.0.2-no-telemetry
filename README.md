## Why this fork?

Audacity [considered including telemetry](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835) and a [major privacy policy change](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213) ([with clarification](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225)). Why? Because they can (yes, really, they don't have a good reason to include tracking their user base). This fork is to ensure there is a copy of the code available before these changes are made.

Audacity has gone back on what they said they were first going to do, but now they almost can't be trusted with making changes which will benefit the community as a whole. This fork is here so you can see the changes before all of that is added.
