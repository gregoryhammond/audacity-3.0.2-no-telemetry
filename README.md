## Why this fork?

Audacity is [considering including telemetry](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835). Why? Because they can (yes, really, they don't have a good reason to include tracking their user base). This fork is to ensure there is a copy of the code available before the telemetry is included.

Audacity has said that telemetry will be disabled by default, but after not saying that in the first place you can't really trust them.
